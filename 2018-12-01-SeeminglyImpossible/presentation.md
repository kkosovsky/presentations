^ Today I am going to talk about seemingly impossible programs. These are programs for which at first glance seem impossible to implement, and indeed common wisdom would tell us that it could be rigorously proven that these programms are impossible to implement. That however does not stop us from implementing them!

^ This for the most part has no practical application to your everyday coding lives. But that's ok because the real point of this talk is to see just how wild and weird the topic of computation is, and I hope it gives us all a sense that there are ideas out there much bigger than us that are difficult to see when we're spending all our time fighting protocols with associated types or UIKit or whatever.

# Seemingly Impossible Swift Programs

^ With that said, the real reason I want to give this talk is because I like math a lot more than i like programming, and this is largely a talk about math. It's not a programming talk that uses some math for some fancy stuff. This 100% a talk about mathematics that has been known in the mathematics community for now 148 years, but its connection to computation is only within the past decade or so.
