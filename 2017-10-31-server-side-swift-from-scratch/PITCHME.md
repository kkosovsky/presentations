Note:
Some of y'all may know me for having worked at Kickstarter, open sourcing our apps and doing a bunch of strange functional programming stuff. But, in my 5.5 years at Kickstarter I did a lot of backend work. I believe I was one of the top 5 contributors to the code base before leaving.

And today i wanna talk about some future directions of server-side swift that will make it state-of-the-art and ahead most other frameworks out there today.

The backend at kickstarter was rails, and that informed a lot of what I thought a web framework was supposed to be like. I think there's a lot of really cool things about rails, some things I even steal directly from them, but I think swift's type system gives us an opportunity to rethink a lot of things, and we can get a much better server side framework in the long run.

the stuff i'm going to show you today i find very exciting, and in fact is some of the coolest stuff I've worked on in awhile. there is a lot to cover, so i'm going to have to skip some details and go pretty quickly, but the best part is everything i'm talking about today is open sourced.

Note: the reason i got into this stuff is because i'm working on a new project with my colleague stephen celis, called point-free. we're creating a video series on swift and functional programming, and we wanted to build the site in server-side swift, so of course we would build a lot of stuff from scratch.
